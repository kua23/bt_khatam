---

## üìù Database Verification

### Check Tables Created
```sql
USE login_db;
SHOW TABLES;
```
Expected tables:
- [ ] `users`
- [ ] `roles`
- [ ] `user_roles`
- [ ] `user_sessions`
- [ ] `audit_logs`
- [ ] `bank_configuration`

### Check Default Data
```sql
-- Should have 6 roles
SELECT * FROM roles;

-- Should have 1 admin user
SELECT username, email, mobile_number FROM users;

-- Should have 1 bank config
SELECT * FROM bank_configuration;
```

---

## üß™ Functional Testing

### Test 1: Get Bank Configuration
- [ ] Open Swagger UI
- [ ] Try `GET /bank-config`
- [ ] Response contains bank name "Credexa Bank"
- [ ] Default language is "en"
- [ ] Default currency is "USD"

### Test 2: Login with Admin
**Using Swagger:**
- [ ] Open `POST /login` endpoint
- [ ] Enter credentials:
  ```json
  {
    "usernameOrEmailOrMobile": "admin",
    "password": "Admin@123"
  }
  ```
- [ ] Click "Execute"
- [ ] Response status: 200 OK
- [ ] Response contains JWT token
- [ ] Response contains user details
- [ ] Response contains roles: ["ROLE_ADMIN"]
- [ ] Copy the JWT token for next tests

**Check Database:**
```sql
-- Last login should be updated
SELECT username, last_login FROM users WHERE username = 'admin';

-- Audit log should have LOGIN_SUCCESS
SELECT * FROM audit_logs ORDER BY event_time DESC LIMIT 5;

-- Active session should exist
SELECT * FROM user_sessions WHERE is_active = TRUE;
```

### Test 3: Register New User
**Using Swagger:**
- [ ] Open `POST /register` endpoint
- [ ] Enter user data:
  ```json
  {
    "username": "testuser",
    "password": "Test@123",
    "email": "test@example.com",
    "mobileNumber": "9876543210",
    "preferredLanguage": "en",
    "preferredCurrency": "USD"
  }
  ```
- [ ] Click "Execute"
- [ ] Response status: 201 Created
- [ ] Response contains user details (password should be null)
- [ ] User has ROLE_USER

**Check Database:**
```sql
-- New user should exist
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'testuser';

-- Password should be BCrypt hashed (starts with $2a$ or $2b$)
SELECT password FROM users WHERE username = 'testuser';

-- User should have ROLE_USER
SELECT u.username, r.name 
FROM users u 
JOIN user_roles ur ON u.id = ur.user_id 
JOIN roles r ON ur.role_id = r.id 
WHERE u.username = 'testuser';
```

### Test 4: Login with New User
- [ ] Use `POST /login` with testuser credentials
- [ ] Login succeeds
- [ ] JWT token received
- [ ] Last login updated in database

### Test 5: Validate Token
- [ ] Use `POST /validate-token`
- [ ] Paste JWT token (in quotes): `"your-token-here"`
- [ ] Response: `{"valid": true, "username": "...", ...}`

### Test 6: Protected Endpoint (Logout)
**Using Swagger:**
- [ ] Click "Authorize" button (üîì icon, top right)
- [ ] Enter: `Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN`
- [ ] Click "Authorize"
- [ ] Try `POST /logout`
- [ ] Response: "Logout successful"

**Check Database:**
```sql
-- Session should be inactive
SELECT is_active, logout_time FROM user_sessions 
WHERE session_token = 'your-token';

-- Audit log should have LOGOUT event
SELECT * FROM audit_logs 
WHERE event_type = 'LOGOUT' 
ORDER BY event_time DESC LIMIT 1;
```

### Test 7: Token After Logout
- [ ] Try to validate the token you just logged out
- [ ] Session should be marked inactive
- [ ] User would need to login again

### Test 8: Failed Login Attempts
**Test Account Locking:**
- [ ] Try to login with wrong password 5 times
- [ ] 6th attempt should return "Account is locked"

**Check Database:**
```sql
SELECT username, failed_login_attempts, account_locked 
FROM users WHERE username = 'testuser';
```

**Reset (for testing):**
```sql
UPDATE users 
SET failed_login_attempts = 0, account_locked = FALSE 
WHERE username = 'testuser';
```

### Test 9: Auto-Logout (5 minutes idle)
**This test takes 5 minutes:**
- [ ] Login with a user
- [ ] Wait 5 minutes without any activity
- [ ] Run scheduled task (or wait for cron job - runs every minute)
- [ ] Check database - session should be inactive
- [ ] Audit log should have AUTO_LOGOUT event

**Manual Check:**
```sql
-- Check session last activity
SELECT user_id, last_activity, is_active 
FROM user_sessions 
WHERE is_active = TRUE;

-- Should auto-logout sessions older than 5 minutes
```

### Test 10: Validation Errors
**Test required fields:**
- [ ] Try register without username ‚Üí Error: "Username is required"
- [ ] Try register without email ‚Üí Error: "Email is required"
- [ ] Try register with short password ‚Üí Error: "Password must be at least 8 characters"
- [ ] Try register with invalid email ‚Üí Error: "Email should be valid"

**Test uniqueness:**
- [ ] Try register with existing username ‚Üí Error: "Username already exists"
- [ ] Try register with existing email ‚Üí Error: "Email already exists"
- [ ] Try register with existing mobile ‚Üí Error: "Mobile number already exists"

---

## üîê Security Testing

### BCrypt Password Hashing
- [ ] Check password in database (should be hashed)
- [ ] Hash should start with `$2a$` or `$2b$`
- [ ] Password should be ~60 characters long

```sql
SELECT username, password, LENGTH(password) as pwd_length 
FROM users;
```

### JWT Token Structure
- [ ] Token has 3 parts separated by dots (header.payload.signature)
- [ ] Can decode header and payload (Base64)
- [ ] Contains username in `sub` claim
- [ ] Contains roles in `roles` claim
- [ ] Has `iat` (issued at) and `exp` (expiration) timestamps

**Decode at:** https://jwt.io

### Session Security
- [ ] Each login creates new session with unique token
- [ ] Old sessions are marked inactive on logout
- [ ] Session contains IP address and User-Agent

---

## üìä Audit Logging

### Check Audit Logs
```sql
-- All login attempts
SELECT username, event_type, success, message, event_time 
FROM audit_logs 
WHERE event_type LIKE '%LOGIN%' 
ORDER BY event_time DESC;

-- Failed login attempts
SELECT username, COUNT(*) as failed_attempts 
FROM audit_logs 
WHERE event_type = 'LOGIN_FAILURE' 
GROUP BY username;
```

Expected event types:
- [ ] USER_REGISTERED
- [ ] LOGIN_SUCCESS
- [ ] LOGIN_FAILURE
- [ ] LOGOUT
- [ ] AUTO_LOGOUT
- [ ] ACCOUNT_LOCKED

# Should see: login-events
```

### Consume Events

kafka-console-consumer.bat --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 \
  --topic login-events --from-beginning
```

Expected events after login:
- [ ] Event with `eventType: "LOGIN_SUCCESS"`
